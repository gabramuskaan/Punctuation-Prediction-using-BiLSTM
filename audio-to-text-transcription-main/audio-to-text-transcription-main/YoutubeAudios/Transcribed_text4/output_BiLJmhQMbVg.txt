 Welcome back in the last lecture we had talked about the notion of an algorithm and I showed you how to write the algorithm for a simple problem in due to compute the factorial of a given number. In this lecture I will try to familiarize you with the basic use of the computer. So, you can start working with the compute right away and whatever we learn in the class you can put that to practical use. But before we start with today's lecture let me once again talk a little bit about class lecture success size. So, if you recall last lecture success was to compute the quotient in the remainder when x is divided by y assuming that only addition and subtraction are available as primitive arithmetic operations. So, how do we go about doing this? Well, we need to use the properties of the quotient in the remainder and as you know if q and r are the quotient in the remainder respectively obtained after dividing x by y then these two properties are satisfied that q times y plus r is equal to x and secondly r is just and y. So, how do we use this property is to come up with an algorithm to compute q and r given x and y. Well, the idea is pretty simple. We keep subtracting y from x repeatedly till we end up with a number which is smaller than y and once we do that then the final number that we are left with is nothing but the remainder r that we are looking for and what is the quotient? The quotient is the number of times that we have subtracted y from x. So, here is a solution to this problem. So, as before we read the values of x and y and the variable q is going to denote the quotient which will essentially count the number of times we are going to subtract y from x till x becomes less than y. So, we initialize value of q to 0 and as long as x is greater than equal to y we perform these two steps and meet step we subtract y from x. So, x becomes x minus y note that we have seen the notation slightly from the last lecture and we are now using a more concise notation. The left arrow here indicates an assignment which means that the value of the variable x is being changed. So, the left hand side of the arrow denotes a variable whose value is being changed and the right hand side denotes the new value that this variable is going to have. So, this statement 3.1 should be read as x assigned x minus y and which means that the new value of x is set to the old value of x minus the value of y. And similarly, since we have subtracted y from x 1 we add 1 to q remember that q counts the number of times that we subtract y from x and finally, after some time since x is decreasing in every step ultimately x will become less than y and at that time we stop executing step number 3 and we come to step 4 which is to print the result the remainder is x remember that every time we have subtracted y from x we have told the result back in x. So, finally, x becomes less than y and it is the remainder and the quotient of course, is the number of times we have subtracted y from x which is nothing but q. So, coming back to today's lecture as I said today I will familiarize you with the basic working and use of a computer so that we can start using the computer to write programs and to execute those programs. In this lecture series we will be using the Linux operating environment. There are several operating systems available for computers as you might have heard of for example, windows, Linux and solaris etcetera. Now, operating environment essentially consists of an operating system and number of application programs. An operating system is a program that manages the computer resources and all application programs run under the control of this software. So, inside there are several operating systems like windows, Linux and solaris will be using Linux for all demonstrations in this particular lecture series. Application programs are useful programs that make it easier and convenient for us to use and program the computer. We will see a number of application programs and see how to use them. Let me first introduce you to the various parts of the computer. This is what is known as the CPU box which contains the drains of the computer and the memory and so on will be talking in a little bit more detail about what this contains. This is a keyboard which as you can see contains keys for various things including which we can type information into the computer and this is what is known as the mouse. This computer is like the different from what you will probably see in your lab. This is a laptop computer. Another thing that you will find in your lab will be monitor attached to the computer. So, this computer trying to this monitor is attached and you can see the output of the computer. So, let us first familiarize ourselves with the keyboard. This is what the keyboard looks like. As you can see that the main area of the keyboard has keys corresponding to the various English alphabet and then we have these number keys at the top. Using these English alphabet keys of course, you can type whatever English words we like. Now, that these keys can be used to type lowercase as well as uppercase English character. So, if I have to type statuses the small G and if I have to type capital G, I have to first press the shift key like this, keep it press and then press the G key and then release the shift key. This is the control key. The control key is used to type special characters. For example, sometimes we might ask you to type control C. What that means is press control, press C and then release both of them one by one. This is the capital of key and if it press H, then what this means is that whichever English character we know type will now appear in upper case instead of in lowercase and if it press H again the capital of mode is now switched off. These are the number keys. On top of the numbers, we also have certain special symbols printed on the keys. So, if I just press this key correctly, then the number 5 will appear whereas, if I want to get the character first and then again I have to press H and then press this key and then release them one by one. This is the back space key. This is also a very important key. If you want to erase something that you have typed previously for us incorrectly, then we just press this and whatever we have typed is erased. This is another important key. This is called the Enter key. Usually most of the time when we type a line of text, we have to then press Enter to say that we whatever we are typing now will appear on the next line. The rest of the keys are not very important at the time linked. We will talk about them whenever we need to. Okay and this is the mouse and if I move this around, you can see this little arrow moving on the screen. This little arrow is called the pointer and using this mouse, I can move this pointer anywhere that I like. Also on this mouse, you can see these two buttons which are called as the left button and the right button. Most of the time the left button will be used whereas occasionally the right button might be used. Okay, so let us now start using the computer. The first screen that we are seeing over here is what is known as the login screen. So here we have supposed to identify ourselves through the system and this identification consists of two parts. The first part is a user name which is signed to us by the system administrator of this computer. So my login name or the user name is ED on this computer. So I move the mouse and make the pointer appear in this small window where I am supposed to type the user name. I click here with the left button so that my whatever I type on the key goes, now we will go here and I type my user name which is BG and after doing that, I have to press enter. Now the computer is requesting me for a password. This password is a secret combination of characters that I alone am supposed to know and if I type this sequence of characters correctly then the computer will be ensured that it is indeed the user DG who is trying to use this computer and if I type this password incorrectly, okay let me type some arbitrary password. So as you can see it says that the user name or the password is incorrect. Let me now correctly login. My user name again is BG. This what I am typing now is my secret password and you can notice that the password is not appearing on the screen. So for obvious reason that if somebody is watching over your shoulder, your password should not be revealed. So after typing my password, once again I just press enter key and the computer is now logging main and this is the initial screen that you are going to see. So once this login process is complete, this is what we get. This entire area is what is known as a desktop. So think of it as the desktop on your physical desk on which you can place some pieces of paper. You do not have any pieces of paper on this desktop yet but we will soon have them. These little pictures are called icons and these are short-cuts to starting some useful applications. So let's start some application programs running. So for example let's first get a calculator program. Let me start another program. We can actually run more than one program at the same time. So let's start a game of chess. So think of these two what are known as windows as pieces of paper on your desk and just like on your desk you can move these windows around on your desk and you can choose which paper should be on the top and so on. So for example if we now want the chess window to be on top all we have to do is take the pointer to the title bar. This is the title bar of this window at the top and flip the left mouse button here. So the chess window now comes on the top. Similarly if I now want the calculator window on the top this is what I have to do. I can move these windows around just like moving papers around on my real desk. So if I want to move this calculator a little bit to the right what I need to do is to take my pointer again to the title bar of this window. Press the left mouse button and keep it pressed like this and how move the mouse while holding the left mouse button down and then the window is in the desired position. I just release the mouse button and the window has this pair and I can do a similar thing with this chess window for example. I can also change the sizes of these windows in most cases. So for example if I want to make this calculator window a little bigger I bring my pointer to the edge of this window and as you can see the pointer shape has changed here and now I again press the left mouse button keep it pressed and move the mouse like this and you can see the calculator window becoming larger and smaller. Another thing that we can do with these windows is to minimize them and that means putting them away will be really need to use them again. So if you see this small button in the title bar for minimization of this window if you just click the left mouse button here then this window has been minimized and you can see that it has come here and if you just click this again it will come back similarly we can minimize it. So in terms of real depth we can choose to put away some of the paper still be actually need to use them. Also and many of these applications you will find things like these which are menu buttons. So if you click your mouse button on any of these you will see a menu of actions that you can choose from for example this recesses the game of session or this using this memory you can choose whether the machine plays white or the machine plays black now the machine has playing the white and we are using the mouse again to make our moves in this game of chess. The next important concept that we need to understand is that of files and directories this is very fundamental to a computer because any piece of information that you wish to store in a computer is stored in a file and every file has a name. So you can think of a file as being a piece of paper on which you can write something and using programs we can create files and put whatever content that you want to place in those files these programs are called text editors using these programs you can also change the contents of a particular file so see the use of a text editor that you later on today. Directors are also a very important concept to understand files are organized into directory so you can think of directory as a folder in which you can place several papers. The only difference here from normal physical folder is that it is very common to actually place folders inside folders. So you have a hierarchical directory structure where you have a directory in which you have some files and some sub directory which also may contain some other files and then some more sub directory and so on so forth. So let us look at the physical directory structure in a unique machine. All these things are folder this folder is called the root directory this is a special directory because this is where the hierarchy of files begin. Everything else is contained directly or indirectly within this root directory. So in this example within this root directory there are three sub directory or sub folders within the same folder which are called home, ETC and bin. So name of the root directory you can see is always flash this is a flash collector and the names of these folders are then flash home, flash ETC, flash bin and this flash in the beginning of the name signifies that this folder is contained within the flash folder which of course is the root directory. So this folder home in this example contains a retaminser folder which is called DG and therefore the complete path starting from the root directory to this folder is flash home flash DG. So the flash character separates the various components of a path and the path is nothing but a sequence of names of folders within which using which the folder or the files can be accessed and in this example this particular folder contains a file which is called letter and therefore the path to this file is flash home, flash DG, flash letter and another folder which is called my folder and therefore the path to this folder is flash home, flash DG, flash my folder. And in this entire directory structure every user is assigned a part of the directory structure within which he or she can create his or her own file. This is called the user home directory. Every user has a system assigned home directory and the user can create any file for the directory within this directory but not elsewhere. So in the previous picture this directory is the home directory of the user DG and within this I can create any files and subfolders that I wish to create. So this part of the directory tree belongs to me in some sense and at any point in sign while the user is working, he is working in some current directory and we can actually change what the directory we are working in at any given point in time. Just after we log in the home directory is also the current directory that is just after the log in the current directory is nothing but the user's home directory. So in my particular example just after I log in the current directory would be flash home, flash DG and as I show you slightly later on we can easily change what the current directory is and therefore it is useful to be able to refer to files not just with reference to its entire path starting from the root directory but also it is convenient to refer to files by their relative path starting from the current directory. The absolute path is a unit is unit to a file and it is a full path starting with flash whereas the relative path is the path for the file relative to the current directory and this will change depending on what the user's current directory at that particular moment happens to be. So for the same file the relative path will be different depending on the current directory and we will see some examples very soon and within the path there are these two special components called dot and dot dot which refer to the current directory and the parent directory of the current directory in the directory tree respectively. So let's see some examples. So this is the same directory structure as before we are assuming in this example that flash home flash DG which as I said is my home directory on this computer is also the current directory and this particular point in time. So these paths in the brackets are the relative path relative to the current directory flash home flash DG. So the path for the current directory itself relative path would be just dot as we said dot is used to refer to the current directory itself and the relative path for this directory namely flash home would be dot dot because as I said dot dot is used to refer to the parent directory of the current directory and similarly the relative path for the root directory would be dot dot flash dot dot because it is the parent of the parent of the current directory and similarly now the ETC directory this particular folder can be referred also as dot dot slash dot slash ETC because this is within the root directory which has the actual relative path dot dot slash dot dot and therefore the relative path of this folder become dot dot slash dot slash ETC and if you look at these two files and folders in my own home directory so relative path for this the actual path for this particular file remember is flash home flash DG flash letter. So the relative path becomes either just letter or dot slash letter because remember again that dot is used to refer to the current directory we do not need to actually use dot here we can just say letter if we do that then because the path is not starting with the flash it is assumed to refer to the it is assumed to be a relative path and similarly relative path for this folder would be either nice folder or dot slash my folder. Let us now look at some of the units commands that you will find helpful to build with files and directory for doing that we need to first start a unique command window so this is how I will start it on this computer it may be a little different on your own machine in the lab so in this menu go to system tools and within this sub menu click at the node that every time I am clicking left mouse button so this brings up a command window in which I can type command first command that you are going to see is very important that is the command to change your password the change of password the command is simply pass some duty this will ask you for the current password in order to ensure that this is not somebody who is using your terminal while you are a puppy and once you are correctly given your current unique password it asks for the new password so let me type some new password I have to type it again to ensure that I haven't made any mistake so I did make some mistakes that time let me try it again okay so the password has been changed successfully having done that let's try out our new password so let's first log out of the system tell the system that you are no longer using it and then log in again for doing that let's first close this command window into close any window we just need to click with the left mouse button on this cross which appears in the title bar of every window so log out will use this menu which you have used earlier so I click here and here is the log out option so I click on this it's asking me to confirm that I really wish to log out so I click here and the system has logged me out and as you can see now we are again back to the login frame and this time when we log in we will have to use our new password so this time I type new password and we have successfully log in so let's start the command window once again system tools terminal we have the command window back the first command that we will look at is called the phwd command which stands phwd stands for print working directory and this shows what our current directory is so as we start off the login the current directory is the same as the user's home directory since my home directory is slash home strategy that's my current directory as well and this is what the output of the phwd command is more that after typing the command I have to press enter let's now see some more command using the cd command which in change the directory and after separated with length you have to specify which directory we need to go to and here we have to give the path of a directory which can be either an absolute path or a relative path let's just go to the root directory which means that I can use the absolute path slash and now we have want the root directory the next command that I remember show is the ls command ls stands for directory listing so this shows the list of files present in the current directory so in the current directory remember is the root directory and these are the files or directories present in the root directory we want to see more details about these will use the ls minus l command note that the ls the words ls and minus l are separated by a blank so it is enter again and we see more details about each of these let's look at some of these details closely this first character for each line says whether this is a directory or a regular file so this game happens to be directly because the first character is D and as a matter of fact in this particular directory in the root directory all the sub files are actually directories so let's try pwd again pwd again shows us slash as the current directory because we have changed into that now if of course we have seen name of the directory and this we have to date at which it was last modified let's let's let me now go back to our home directory which always will take me to the home directory so pwd here shows home strategy again let us try an ls minus l command here the ls minus l command here shows that within this directory slash home strategy there is a directory called ssop because there is a D here and there is a file called tsc.chd this gives a date at which this file was last modified and this gives the number of characters present in the file we can see what this file contains by using the cat command so again for the cat command I have to give as argument to the command the path to the file and since the file pwd.chd happens to be in the current directory we can directly use the relative path which would be simply csc.chd and this is what are the contents of the file let's now use a text editor to create a new text file and see how we can change the contents of an existing text file or create a new text file so one of the text editor programs available in the line is called t-added and as an option to this as an argument to this command I have to give the file name that I want to create so let me name the new file that we are going to create as ryd.chd so the command is here again blank ryd.chd and this is the text editor window now and I can type here so for example I have type this is a new text file that we are creating if I now want the next words to appear on the next line all I have to do is press enter and as you can see this blinking cursor has come to the next line whatever I type here will now go on the next line so I want to edit something if I have made a mistake in what I just said I can of course use the back space key to erase what I have just done and if I want to change something in text long time back I for example if I want to change this a with the then what I can do is take the pointer here click here this half to be a so the cursor has now come here now press back space and start typing the new text that I want to enter we can also do more interesting things for example we can create we can tag regions of the text and delete them and mask for example if I want to delete the world text here of course I could take the cursor here and press black say four times to delete the entire world but I could also select this entire world and to select this I have to first bring the cursor just before this world and then to select this world what I do is press the left mouse button keep it fresh and drag it a little bit towards the right till the entire world is selected or whatever text I want to select has been highlighted now once the world text file has been highlighted I can press black space so the entire two words will go away and I can replace it with something else for example letter or I could do more interesting things such as if I want to make copy of this engine I can select this entire sentence like this and then usually copy command there is a shortcut to the copy command on this menu so this letter icon says for copy so when I say copy the selected text is copied it does not appear anywhere on the screen but if I now say take then this whatever has been copied will appear wherever the cursor happens to be so this is the icon for the for paste if I press this is what I get okay let me now change this little bit again okay suppose we want to interchange the order of these two lines what do we need to do well let me first select this and then instead of copying this entire line I will touch this entire line using this silver light picture over here so I touch this so this disappears and it has also been copied in some internal space now if I bring my cursor here I can also use the arrow keys to move the cursor around as you just saw so I create a blank line here and if I paste now then the original selection that we have set appears over here now we would after typically creating the contents of the file once we are satisfied with the content we would typically want to save the file what saving means is that so far what we have been doing in this editor window has not actually been written to the file on the system so if we wanted to be actually written to the file on the system we have to first save the contents of the editor window for the file and to save the file all we need to do is to click this small copy disk like image and this the file has been written you can see here wrote try to text now we can close this editor window and try to see what contents has been written in this file so using the old command chat you can see the contents of this file this says this is the new text file that we are creating this is the new letter that we are creating this is precisely what we had entered in this text file so as you can see using this editor program we can create whatever text document that we want to create and in particular we will see that if program is also a text document and will use the same program to actually write new program that we develop ourselves that also now try to edit an existing file again so let's just edit this file try it or take once again and as you can see the old contents have come back I can now change whatever I like to make whatever changes I like to make save it close this window and changes have taken effect okay another thing that you would like to do is to organize our files that we create into folder and therefore we need to be able to create new folder and the command to do that is encoder so I can create a new folder within this current directory itself so using this command encoder I am saying that I want to create a new folder whose name will be new folder and now if I look at the directory contents you can see that the new folder has been created I can now change directory into this folder and if I want I can create some files LF shows nothing here because there is no files in this folder yet I can use the editor command as before to create some files here we can also make more copies of an existing file and do that we have to use the cc command cp stands for copy and this time we have to give it to argument the first argument is the part to an existing file which you want to copy somewhere else so let's copy the try.cxt file that we just created and since this is in the parent directory of the current directory remember that the current directory is slash home slash eg slash new folder whereas the file that we created was in slash home slash eg so the relative path to this file would be dot dot slash try.cxt and the second argument is where we want to copy this so we want to copy this to the current directory and to refer to that we can just use dot as a side earlier and this copies the file to the current directory let's have a look using the Alice-Alpha- so as you can see in the directory new folder there is a file try.cxt and the contents are the same as what we are in the original try.cxt and in the parent directory which is my home directory also there is a file try.cxt with the same contents. We can also move files from one place to another for example if we want to move this file psc.x to the new folder that is just created we use the process similar to what we used for hopping files but this time you will see mv command which stands for move we can use to move file to another directory we can also use it to assign a different name to an existing file so suppose we move it to the new folder as you can see the file is no longer in this folder and if we go to new folder the file has appeared here we can also use the move command to actually change the name of the file so if I use this command the name of the file is changed to xyz.cxt. So here is a summary of the unique commands that we have seen today the passable disk command is used to change your password the Alice command is used to list the files in directory the cd command is used to change the parent directory the pwd command is used to print ctern directory or the working directory the cat command is used to display the contents of the file the key edit command is used to create or edit the contents of the file the cp command is used to copy a file and the mv command is used to move a file. So in today's lecture we have familiarized ourselves about using a computer the notion of files and directories how to create files and directories to edit files and so on so forth and as an exercise for today please try all the things that we have seen here today in the lecture in your lab or at home using your own computer from the next time onwards we will actually start writing some programs.
