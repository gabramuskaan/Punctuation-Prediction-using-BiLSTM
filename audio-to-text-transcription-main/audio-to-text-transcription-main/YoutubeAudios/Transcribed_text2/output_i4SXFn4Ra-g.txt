 We have discussed about passing arrays as parameters and for passing arrays as parameters in C to C functions we take recalls to call by reference. Otherwise for all other parameter passing we take recalls to call by value and just to summarize the call by value and call by reference the references in call by value we copy the value of the actual parameter to the formal parameter, formal argument and in call by reference we do not copy the value but we just pass on the address or the pointer and reference to the actual parameter. So, as a result what happens that if any change to that variable is resulted in the function itself in the case of call by value that will not be automatically reflected to the main program but in the case of call by reference since there is no other separate copy that will automatically be reflected. Just to conclude that part we will see a number of applications of functions just to conclude that let us have a quick look at one function there is no array but just solution of the prototypes that you can see here finding the maximum of three integers. So, we have the header file here include stdiu.h then here we declared a function prototype the actual function maximum has been written later. So, here you see that what does this line tell us this line tells us that maximum is a function and it consists of three integer arguments or three integer parameters will come. So, as if this is a function which has got three input doors and each door is wide enough to accommodate an integer. So, that much is told and whatever is inside this I am not aware of that and at this stage I am not aware of that and the output will also be another integer that is told by this. Then so here the cellion point to see is that here I have just it is sufficient to just specify the types no names have been put in. Now comes the main program that is very simple a, b, c are three integers. So, they are local to this function enter the integers a, b, c are entered here. So, you know what a is what b is and what c is and then you are calling inside c here inside the printf I can call maximum with the parameter a, b, c and we come here. And here I have defined here I did not name here I did not name the variables here I have defined the names of variables in text into I in Z. So, this x, y, z are again property of this maximum. So, x, y, z are here and the algorithm of the logic is simple initially I make max to be x if y is greater than max and y is the max otherwise z is the max and then I am returning max. I am returning max means I am coming here and then that max is being printed and return 0. Now, my main function what is my main main is here main has got a type int. So, I am returning 0. So, int will if at the end of the main function a 0 is returned I will assume that the program has successfully completed. The reason I brought of this example is just to illustrate this case that you need not at the prototype level you can escape specifying the parameters. So, here is the prototype declaration function calling and function definition you know that. So, this are already repeated I am not going into that. So, instead I will be talking about a function of the parameter I will be talking about the new thing here that is hash include we have talked about hash include we have used hash include and we mentioned that hash include is nothing but a pre processor statement a pre processor statement how say hash include filing we have seen hash include a steady I O dot H, but it can be for that matter any file name hash include file name say for example, I can specify the full path say slash us R in a Linux environment slash home Rager my file dot H. I want to include this file I want to include this file in my for serving this file in my program. The content of the corresponding file will be included in the present file before compilation is done and the compiler will compile thereafter considering the content as it is. So, it is a pre processor statement that is I put that inside that hash include that file is included and then the compilation is done okay. Now, let us look at this hash include example look at this program segment which is my source program which is known as proc dot C. So, this my source program this source program has got hash include no steady I O dot H, but it has just said that in hash include my file dot H and then the main program follows okay. Now, now this my file dot H is nothing but another file which is which has got hash include a steady I O dot H and in text. So, when I include my file dot H then this particular file will be included this particular file that is this segment will be included here. So, consequently what will happen is when I say in general hash include file name dot H it includes the file name file file name dot H from a specific directory which is known as the include directory when I say hash include it takes from the include directory and in the include directory I have kept my file dot H and consequently when that is included the ultimately the thing that looks like is it will look like this because that hash include I am sorry there should not be an inverted comma here it should be just hash include a steady I O dot H followed by in text. So, this whole thing whole thing has been has replaced my file dot H and where was my file dot H my file dot H was under user us are include file name dot H. So, that is how the include I can have other files included in my program. Now, another point of critical discussion is macro definition we have seen the macros like hash define. So, let us so that is again a pre processor directive we have seen that hash include is a pre processor command that means, even before the compilation is done that is that is copied there on the other hand you see the pre processor directive of hash define string 1 string 2 that means, string 1 should be replaced by string 2. So, how does it happen it replaces string 1 by string 2 whenever it occurs wherever it occurs wherever it occurs before compilation. So, for example, hash define pi to be 3.14. So, wherever it will find this pi wherever it will find this pi it will replace that with 3.14. So, here for example, you see we have got hash include stdi dot H then we define pi to be 3.14 as the hash define pre processor command. Now, in my main program I have got float R 4 time 4 R is 4 and area is another variable both are float. Now, area is pi timeswatch R is initialized. So, when we have done this we see that is pi times which we have done before this graph again we have done this graph before this graph wow our graph now we can see the. Now if you will dynamically recall you become now as area is pi times r times r, r is already initialized. So, what will happen is this will be translated to this pi will be replaced. So, the body will be float r assigned 4 and area and area is so r is 4 and area will be 3.14 times r times r. So, even before compilation this pi is being replaced by the value 3.14 as has been stated in the hash defined command. We can also give hash defined with an argument. Till now we have seen hash defined pi as a constant has defined some constant k to be 5 or whatever. Here we can also define some functions like you see hash defined square x is x times x. So, wherever square x will appear that will be replaced by x times x. So, for example here let us look at this program again. I think you are not being able to read this. So, let me go back say let me have if I have declared say hash defined square x is x times x. Then in my program wherever I will get say p is assigned square y. So, this will be be translated as p assigned y times y. So, this what should be done that has already been told here that square x is this. So, this will simply replace it. So, that is the purpose of hash defined here we can see that. So, let us look at this example again main y is 5. Print of value is y times y. That means, this is being rep this is what has been generated after the square x has been square here it was square x plus 3. So, that has become y times y plus 3. Now, which one is faster to execute? You can think of I can if I write square x written as a macro definition then I am pasting as if I am pasting the body of the code inside this in the main program replacing that. So, I do not need to call any function. I can write it as a macro definition and I as a result even before compilation even before compilation I can get this look. And so, this can be straight way applied without requiring to call a function. Now, if square x is written as an ordinary function not like a macro definition in that case I have to call a function and calling a function has got some overheads which I am not discussing here. So, if it be a very simple thing like this is better to make it a macro. So, that it automatically gets pasted and it becomes faster. However, there is a word of caution for example, if I had defined square x now it is now when I am defining as a macro it is I have to ensure that it is correct. Therefore, if I define square x as x times x now how the macro definition substitution will be carried out let us look at this. If there be something like r assign square of a plus square of 30. So, it will be a times a plus 30 times 30 that is how it will happen. Now, what about r square of a plus b it will be simply pasted as a plus b times a plus b consequently the result will be wrong because during execution b times a will be done first and then that will be added with a and with b. So, this is not what I intended therefore, if I had done this define this as like this and like this this problem would not have occurred. So, unless I do that this a plus b should will not be I need to take if I define it like this then it becomes this which is correct one. But, unless I do that it will lead to a wrong result. So, you must be very careful about it this is wrong and the macro definition should have been written as as I have shown square x is x times x in that case we would have got the correct result. Now, before moving to anything else we will now look at some applications of what we have learnt. We are now at a position where we have to be able to see the result. I have learnt all the fundamental tools without the sophistications that are required to write a program. So, suppose I want to solve a problem like this that I have got 5 students in the class and the 5 students have got 5 names of course, and I have got 5 names of and each of them have got some marks total marks. Now, how do I represent that and I want to find out which student I want to print the name of the student who has got the highest marks is the problem clear. Let me repeat the problem I have got 5 students in a class and I want to find out which student has got the highest marks and I want to know the name of that student. How can I solve this problem this is a simple problem here what I will need is first I will need an array of the names of the students. So, first I need an array of the names of the students. So, here 5 names will be stored very very disproportionate array and let me call this array to be name or names and on this side I have got another array which holds the marks of the of the different students. Corresponding to the next class I will have to write this name and I will have to write this name and I will have to write this name and I will have to write this name and the marks of the of the different students corresponding to the role number may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 the marks are stored here somebody got 50 somebody got 55 somebody got 62 somebody 70 somebody 32 say and their names are ABC and they are in the same way. L M P Q X and Y suppose these are names these are different names. Now, why do I need 2 arrays these are these are the array called marks why do I need 2 arrays first of all the arrays should be holding same type of data. So, what is the type of data that the array names is holding it is a array of character or character string. Now, how can I represent these names I can represent them as an array of strings or each of these names is what how can I represent these names I can represent them as an array of strings or each of these names is what each of these names is a character. Therefore, if I just look at names names will look like a 2 dimensional array. Now, what would be my algorithm first of all come to the representation later what would be my algorithm first of all I will have to go to this marks array which is simpler it is an array of integers assuming all integer marks are given then I will have to carry out find out the maximum of this and you can write a function to find the maximum of an array right. So, let us try to write the function first. So, I have got an array marks I have got a function that I have got a function that which has got 5 elements all right. So, I can call a function max what let us first of all think of this maximum volume what will it return me say it will find out say if I come to this it will find out which one is the maximum and will return me an index right or this is not the maximum sorry this one is the maximum. So, it will return me an index 0 1 2 3. So, it will return me an integer therefore, I can start with like this that int maximum of I can call an array integer array int suppose that is m this and the main function will call it with marks and inside this what will happen you know initially let me call a value int this is a local max assigned m 0. So, initialize a variable max with m 0. Now, for I assigned some index I so I have to declare I also here I have got this m 0 and I have got this m 0. So, I have got this m 0 and I have got this m 0 and I have got this m 0. So, I assigned 1 I less than equal to 5 less than equal to 4 sorry less than equal to 4 I plus plus here if m I is greater than max then if then max is 0. So, this is the maximum max is 0. So, m I and that will go on now ultimately what shall I return from this should I return the max no I am returning the value of I because where I found the maximum now. So, for that now this I is changing. So, here I will also have to make say so let me just make this I to be 0 let me make this I to be initially I is 0. So, I will also have to make this I to I could have done a with this and wherever I get this max I am changing this I wherever I am getting this max I can say that there is another max index and I am making max index equals I. So, I am remembering where I found the max and I will be returning the max index. So, my maximum function in this way what it will do is it will sorry it will find out the maximum. So, it will return 3. So, the first thing is find max now I have got an adenymes how is that represented the representation can be as strings or it can be as an adiab or it can be as an adiab of characters. If I consider this to be an adiab of characters then remember that is a 2 dimensional adiab and I in that case I will take so this 3 and I will come to this 3 this and I will print out this particular element from that adiab. So, now what about this names let us see names is an adiab say p q r or something. So, I can have this as an adiab of characters so p q r is a p q r and I can have this as a l m whatever it is and this part is blank. So, what is my declaration of names names will be there are 5 names 5 rows and each row is a character. So, it is a character adiab, character so it is a character adiab, care names let me write it here care names 5 rows and each row may have 3 columns. So, this is a character adiab of characters and right adiab like this l m p l m k p q r like that say. Now, I have suppose come with that maximum index was this rows so that is 3. Now, how do I print this p q r name here if it is kept as a string I could have straight with percentage s format, but here how do I do with this here I can I will have I will print which row I will print I am not writing the entire code print f which row would I print I print the names 3, but there are 3 characters so names 3 in a loop I have to print right. So, print f so how how the printing be done how do I print 1 row of an array a 2 dimensional. So, here I come so I will print in a loop names 3 0 3 1 3 2 actually this is 3 should be summer here it is confusing 3 should be summer here say a b c so 3 is actually this row so names I will be printing 3 0 3 1 3 2 and that I can print in a for loop. So, I leave it to you to try to print this in the character format you can also try it in the string format. So, what we have done here is we have seen the how the macros are replaced and we will see further examples of functions all through in the future lectures where we will be applying functions and add is consequently.
