 We were discussing about arrays and we have seen how we can read an array, we have seen how we can print an array, we have also seen how we can access the different elements of an array using for loops and while loops. Now, couple of things that we cannot do using an array are as you can see here, we cannot use this equal it is this assignment for assigning one array variable to another. For example, if I have suppose I have one array E, suppose I have one array E which is this array having some elements, suppose it is an integer array and the elements here are 15, 6, 7, 9, 10. Now, and there is another array B like this, I want that this data be transferred to 1 to this array B as 15, 6, 7, 9, 10. Now, that I cannot do using A assigned B, I cannot do this or B assigned A, I am sorry this is wrong, using B assigned A, I cannot do that. However, it is true that A is also a variable of type array and B is also a variable of type array. But for other variable types, for example, if A is a integer variable and B is another integer variable and A was 15 and then I could have assigned B assigned A, so B will become 15. But this sort of straightforward assignment cannot be done in the case of an array. What we have to do in order to do such assignments in an array is that we will have to do it component by component element by element. For example, I can do this, let me again take another array A. Now, this time I take an array A to be a little smaller of say 4 elements, 1, 3, 2, 7 and there is another element B and I actually intend my intention is that the data in A goes to the array B. Now, as I said for an array, I have to do it element by element. So, suppose this there are 4 elements in the array and I write a for loop for I equals 0 I less than equal to 3 I plus plus B I is assigned A I. What will happen through this A I is 0, so A I that means A is 0, this element will be taken and that will be copied to the 0th element of B here, both of them are I, so that 0. So, this will become 1. Next, I is incremented, so I becomes 1, so this element is being pointed at and I transfer this element to the corresponding element, this will also be incremented I, this is also I. So, I is 1, so this will be copied here. Similarly for this element, next in this loop I will be incremented and this will be loaded here. Similarly for the last element it will go on. Therefore, ultimately I will get the same thing 1, 3, 2, 7 as was my intention, but I cannot do it directly, but I have to do it in the form of a loop, element by element I have to transfer them. So, we cannot use this assignment directly, what else am I prohibited to do? So, A and B are 2 add is I cannot do this, also I cannot compare 2 arrays using this sort of equality checker. Earlier we have seen that I can check where the 2 elements are equal logical operation, I could do it using normal A equals B, I am sorry, A is B, if A was a variable 15 and B was another variable 15, in that case A equality checker B will lead to a value 1 or true, but if A is an array and B is another array, I cannot do it directly in that way. They are also I can write a piece of program in which I can check them element by element. So, please note suppose I have got an array A, which is 2, 4, 5, 7, another array B is 2, 4, 5, 7, then these 2 arrays are equal, however if I have an array with the same elements, but in a different arrangement say for example, 2, 5, 4, 7, these 2, this A and C are not the same. Therefore, how can I compare, how can I compare these 2 arrays, how can I compare them, in order to compare these 2 arrays A and B, what I need to do is I have to write a small loop like for, let me do it clearly. So, I have got an array, I have got an array 2, 5, 7, 4, another array 2, 5, 7, 4 A and B are the equal, I can compare them, I want to compare them, compare A and B. Now, what can I do, I can do it in this way for I 0, I less than equal to 3 because there are 4 elements in the array, I plus plus. Suppose, I put a flag here, a variable flag equals 1. Suppose, I keep a flag variable, I initialize it to 1, now for I equal to 1 to 0 or let me make it simpler, I keep it 0, initially this is 0. So, now I do, if A i is equal to B i, flag is assigned 1 and flag is assigned 1, else flag assigned 0 and I come out of this. So, what I am trying to do is here, let me avoid this part for the time being, let see we will develop it gradually. What will happen here, if this is done, let see for if I do this, if I run this piece of code, then what will happen? For I equal to 0, that means, I will be comparing with this and if A i is equal to B i, that means I am comparing these two, if these two are equal, then flag is 1, that means till now it is 1, but this will go on here. So, here 1, now 5 and 5 is 1, fine, 7 and 7 is compared, again it is written 1, 4 and 4, again it is written 1. So, it has been done and ultimately come out with the value of flag, ultimately I come out, when I come out of this, the value of flag is 1 and so I can say, if flag is 1, then they are equal. But there is some problem with this program, what is that? First of all, every time I was assigning flag to be 1, that is one problem. Now, suppose another problem is, suppose this value is 6, then what will happen? Let us trace this once again, 2 and 2 will match, so the value of flag will be 1, fine, 5 and 5 will be matched. Again, I am not bothering about how many times unnecessarily, I am writing into flag, that apart, flag will be 1. Now, 7 and 6, they are not equal to 1, so I will come out of this if statement, but will go again in the loop. So, what should I do here? If this is not equal, then I will have to set flag to 0, if there is a mismatch. So, if I do it like this, then what will happen? It is this part. If I is equal to be B I, then flag will be 1 and else, that means, with this, else flag will be 0. So, ultimately now, suppose, but here again there is a problem, what will happen? So, 7 and 6 are not matching, so this is not true, so flag will be 0. And then, I will again go into the loop, because the loop has not yet ended and here I will find that these two elements are equal 4 and 4. So, it will come at this point and flag will be 1 and then, I come out of the loop, I will come out with flag equal to 1, but these two areas are not equal, because I can see that the elements are different. So, this problem, this program will not solve my purpose. I leave it to you for a while to see how to think, how you can solve this problem. You need to apply your mind a little bit to write this piece of program, which will simply check whether two areas are equal or not. If they are equal, that means, if the elements are the same at every position, corresponding position, the elements are same. In that case, it will come out with a flag value of 1, otherwise it will come out with the flag value of 0. That is the task. I hope you understand where the problem is in this program. You see here, had the mismatch been at the last point, last moment, at the last element, 7, 6, then it would have worked fine. So, that is why at the beginning we said, this is not just C programming, it is learning to write programs using logic. Suppose this, this was 7 and this was 3. Then, that is not equal. Here, flag would be 1, here flag would be 1, here flag would be 0 and it would come out and my answer would be correct. The answer is correct by chance, because as we have seen that, here, if I have an error, if I have a mismatch, here and suppose here, the things are alright. Then, once gate the flag is 0, but next time that flag will be made to 1 and ultimately when I come out, I will have the flag value to be 1. So, the correct answer has eluded me. So, you just think of how I can modify this program such that I get the correct result as I intended. So, we cannot use these directly, directly compare the array variables. I cannot compare what else? So, if A assigned B, this sort of thing I cannot do. Also, the other thing that I cannot do is, can if and print of statements, I cannot read the array in one shot that is not allowed. I could normally, normally what could I do? Normally, if I have a variable A, some variable value 5, I could have simply done print F percentage D A. So, this could be printed. Similarly, I could have done scan F percentage D and A. I could have read a value here. But, if it is an array, I cannot do it in this way. We already know how we can do that? We know that in order to read an array, what we need to do is read it again in a loop, in a fall loop. So, it can be for I assigned 0, I less than equal to whatever 3, I plus plus scan F percentage D and A. So, this array A will be read element by element I equal to 0. So, first this element will be read, might be 5, whatever element is 5, then might be 7, etc. In that way, I can read them element by element. Similarly, for printing an array 6, 4, for printing an array, I can simply again do that for say J assigned 0, J. Let me change a little bit. Is any trouble here? J less than 3, J plus plus print F percentage D A I. Here of course, I do not give the scan F again. Now, is any problem with this? Here I made I less than equal to 3. Here I am making J less than 3 for the same size of array. You can think of, you can look at it. This is also correct, because here I am starting with 1. So, 1, I am looking at now, there is a mistake here. I have done a couple of mistakes. What will happen here? J first of all, this was an unintentional mistake. So, this is J. Now, how will the array be printed here? If I do it in this way, what will be printed? Here, first thing that will be printed is J, A J. What is the value of J? 1. So, what is A J? A 1? That is this element. So, 7 will be printed. Suppose, I have got a backslash end here. So, 7 will be printed. Then, 6 will be printed, because I is now 2, I is now 3, then 4 will be printed, but till less than 3. Therefore, 1, 2, 3, this will not be printed. Also again, I am missing this one. What should I do? I can make it J minus 1. What will happen in that case? I am printing J is 1, and I am printing A J minus 1. That means, I am printing A 0 5. Next, J becomes 2. So, I will be printing J minus 1. That means, 2 minus 1, A 1, 7, then 6. Then, J becomes 2. Then, J becomes 3. So, 3 minus 1, 2, I have printed. Now, J will be incremented. It will be 3. The last one will not be printed. Here, also, I have to make it less than equal to 3. Was this one all right? Just quickly check. This is a common source of error. I am reading this array. Let me do it again. I am reading this array. A 0, then I have read A 0, then I is incremented. So, the 4 elements, so I will come up to A 3. So, the second one, I am reading the second one, A I is 1. So, A 1, I is next 2, A 2, and then A 3. So, this is okay. So, you have to be very careful about all this. So, reading and printing, reading and printing, we cannot directly do. We have also to do it through a loop. So, I cannot do like this. How to copy elements of one array to another by copying individual elements? I have already shown that. So, that is what we have to say about arrays right now. Now, we will come to some examples. Say, I want to, this is an example of copying an array. There are 2 arrays A, 25, and B 25. So, I am trying to copy them. So, you know that I can do it by copying it in this way. Now, some problems we will write to try out now. One is finding the mean and standard deviation of a set of in numbers. I leave this standard deviation part. We can try to do that. Mean, you know mean is the arithmetic average. So, I will first try to find write a program where all of you will be able to write. Find the mean and standard deviation of a set of in numbers. So, what are you going to do? Mean means the average right. So, I add the numbers, all the numbers. Suppose, my array is A. So, each element i designate as A i is an element. So, I will have sigma A i, i varying from 1 to 1. Whatever this size is divided by N, that is the average. I add all the numbers. So, it is simple to write the program. Suppose, I have read the array. First of all, I have to read the elements in an array. So, summarizing all what you have learnt, what should be my first statement? First statement is declaring the array. Let me declare an array in A. Suppose, the size of that is 5. Maximum size possible. And I also have some and I have got another variable A V G. All our integers. Again A V G may not be integer. Mean may not be integer. So, and then I have got another float A V G. Now, first I have to read the array. So, read the numbers. I am making a shortcut. I am leaving out the print of statement. Please enter the array. That part I am leaving out. Then what I am doing here? Here of course, for i assigned 0, i less than, suppose there are 5 elements. I less than 5 i plus plus. If it was some other value, then I would have put it N here. And I had to read the N before I read the array. So, I do this. And then initially, I can make it the sum here to be sum is initialized to 0. Now, for i equal to 0 i less than m i plus plus I read there. So, I am just reading the array. So, what I do? Scanif percentage D, amperesand A i. I am reading that. And then here in this fall loop, I can repeatedly compute the sum. Sum equals sum plus A i. So, I will get the sum here ultimately at the end of the loop. At the end of the loop, I will get the sum. So, now here I can write average is sum divided by whatever the value was. I have taken 5 to be a fixed value. So, I divided 5. And that is the average. So, in that way I can find out the mean. This value. The next task is computing the standard deviation. So, that I will leave to you for the time being, we will take it up later.
