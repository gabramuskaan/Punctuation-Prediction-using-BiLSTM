 Hello welcome to NPTEL's MOOC on Introduction to Programming in C. I am the instructor of the course Satyadev, an assistant professor at the Department of CSE and IIT Kanpur. So what is this course about? It introduces programmers to programming using the C language which is an old and fairly popular language. The course emphasizes solving problems algorithmically and writing readable and maintainable code for the solutions to these problems in the C language and also the art of understanding code written by others and extending them if possible. So what is programming involve? We will take a look at certain problems and then given a problem we will look into first what do we mean by an algorithmic solution to a problem. So this is the logic of how to solve the problem then how do we code this in C? So this is concerned with the syntax of the language given an algorithm. How do we code the algorithm of in C? Once we have a solution to a problem it is important to know how good the solution is are they better solutions. What do we mean by running time of this code? Are there code which will solve the problems faster using less memory and so on? So we are concerned with the complexity of the problem and also in certain coding practices which makes our code readable and extendable by others. After all programming is a social activity and it is very rare that large software systems are written by single programmers. So in the course we will try to emphasize a very basic introduction to modular design of the code. How do you break up a problem into simpler components which you can then build up to build the solution to the entire problem. So here is a code by one of the famous computer scientists who says that the price of reliable code is the pursuit of simple code. The photograph is a very famous engineering feat which is known as the Bailey Bridge which epitomizes modular design. This is a bridge that can be built essentially by teams of five or six human beings without the need for heavy lifting equipment and in some sense the analogy of software engineering is that of a Bailey Bridge being built by small teams of human beings working together and making interchangeable parts. So we hope that you have fun in this course and enjoy your time learning and coding in C. Thank you.
